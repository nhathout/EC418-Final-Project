Joshua Bardwick, Hilario Gonzalez, Noah Hathout
This repository holds our final project from reinforcement learning at Boston University. Our goal was to optimize performance on the MarioKart-esque driving simulator called pySuperTuxKart. 
Our approach and results are outlined in FinalReport.pdf.

Thanks to Dr. Alex Olshevsky for teaching this course!
